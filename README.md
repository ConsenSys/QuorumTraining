## Exercises
We are completely reworking the exercises that are part of the Quorum training.  In order to make it clear to anyone doing the training what the process is, and to make it easy to go through the exercises we have created a Quorum Training Platform that takes anyone step by step through the process of:

* Setting up a Quorum node
* Joining that node to a Quorum network
* Creating Accounts on the node
* Deploying contracts to the Quorum network
* Interacting with those contracts
* Deploying confidential contracts into Quorum constellations
* Interacting with those confidential contracts
* Viewing the status of the network

The wireframes for the training platform can be found here:

The Quorum training platform relies heavily on the [Quorum Network Manager](https://github.com/ConsenSys/QuorumNetworkManager)

## Setting up the Quorum Training Platform
